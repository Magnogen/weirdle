wordle practice

i wanted a little wordle practice app, as im not very good at it

so i made one

:P

oh yeah and full credit goes to [Josh Wardle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/) for the idea, i know im a bit late to the party lol

| file | respective difficulty | credit/notes |
| -    | -                     | -            |
| `freqlist.txt` | easy | from [Frequency List](https://frequencylist.com) - a nice little list of words, or a little list of nice words if you will, or any other combination of adjectives you might want to associate with this |
| `wordle-pickable.txt` | medium | i got it from [a gist by scholtes](https://gist.github.com/scholtes/94f3c0303ba6a7768b47583aff36654d) - who had it stored from back when wordle was open source (i couldnt find it now for some reason, big company reasons ig) |
| `wordle-other.txt` | hard | also from [the gist i mentioned above](https://gist.github.com/scholtes/94f3c0303ba6a7768b47583aff36654d), its used as words you can enter, but will never need to guess in the original wordle. a word of caution though - most of these dont even look like words to me, so expect things like "aargh" (yes thats actually in the list lmao) |

yes, you can use a regex search to find the answers in the txt files, no i dont care if you do or not. its practice after all, its not like it saves how well you do or sends any information back to any servers or anything
